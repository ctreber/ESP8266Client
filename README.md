# ESP8266Client

An Arduino ESP8266 Client implementation based on [https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_WeeESP8266], in example to be used as the WLAN backend of the PubSub MQTT library.

Sorry guys, I am new to git and GitHub and still setting this up. I am aware the dependencies (like, to Logsury) are missing as well as of now. Not sure how much time I can spare to work on this.
